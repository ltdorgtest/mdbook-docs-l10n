msgstr ""

#: src/continuous-integration.md:54
msgid ""
"`--no-default-features` --- Disables features like the HTTP server used by "
"`mdbook serve` that is likely not needed on CI. This will speed up the build "
"time significantly."
msgstr ""

#: src/continuous-integration.md:56
msgid ""
"`--features search` --- Disabling default features means you should then "

#: src/continuous-integration.md:57
msgid ""
"`--vers \"^0.4\"` --- This will install the most recent version of the `0.4` "
"series. However, versions after like `0.5.0` won't be installed, as they may "
"break your build. Cargo will automatically upgrade mdBook if you have an "
"older version already installed."
msgstr ""

#: src/continuous-integration.md:60
msgid ""
"`--locked` --- This will use the dependencies that were used when mdBook was "
"released. Without `--locked`, it will use the latest version of all "
"dependencies, which may include some fixes since the last release, but may "
"also (rarely) cause build problems."
