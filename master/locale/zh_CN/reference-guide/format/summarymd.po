"This markdown file must be named `SUMMARY.md`. Its formatting is very strict "
"and must follow the structure outlined below to allow for easy parsing. Any "
"element not specified below, be it formatting or textual, is likely to be "

"_**Title**_ - While optional, it's common practice to begin with a title, "
"generally <code\n"
"class=\"language-markdown\">\\# Summary</code>. This is ignored by the "
"parser however, and can be omitted."
msgstr ""

#: src/format/summary.md:21
msgid ""
"_**Prefix Chapter**_ - Before the main numbered chapters, prefix chapters "
"can be added that will not be numbered. This is useful for forewords, "
"introductions, etc. There are, however, some constraints. Prefix chapters "
"cannot be nested; they should all be on the root level. And you cannot add "
"prefix chapters once you have added numbered chapters."
msgstr ""

#: src/format/summary.md:32
msgid ""
"_**Part Title**_ - Level 1 headers can be used as a title for the following "
"numbered chapters. This can be used to logically separate different sections "
"of the book. The title is rendered as unclickable text. Titles are optional, "
"and the numbered chapters can be broken into as many parts as desired. Part "
"titles must be h1 headers (one `#`), other heading levels are ignored."
msgstr ""

#: src/format/summary.md:44
msgid ""
"_**Numbered Chapter**_ - Numbered chapters outline the main content of the "
"book and can be nested, resulting in a nice hierarchy (chapters, sub-"
"chapters, etc.)."

"Numbered chapters can be denoted with either `-` or `*` (do not mix "
"delimiters)."

"_**Suffix Chapter**_ - Like prefix chapters, suffix chapters are unnumbered, "
"but they come after numbered chapters."
msgstr ""

#: src/format/summary.md:68
msgid ""
"_**Draft chapters**_ - Draft chapters are chapters without a file and thus "
"content. The purpose of a draft chapter is to signal future chapters still "
"to be written. Or when still laying out the structure of the book to avoid "
"creating the files while you are still changing the structure of the book a "
"lot. Draft chapters will be rendered in the HTML renderer as disabled links "
"in the table of contents, as you can see for the next chapter in the table "
"of contents on the left. Draft chapters are written like normal chapters but "
"without writing the path to the file."

#: src/format/summary.md:79
msgid ""
"_**Separators**_ - Separators can be added before, in between, and after any "
"other element. They result in an HTML rendered line in the built table of "
"contents.  A separator is a line containing exclusively dashes and at least "
"three of them: `---`."
