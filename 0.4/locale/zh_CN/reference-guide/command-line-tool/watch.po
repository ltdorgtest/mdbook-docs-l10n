"The `watch` command is useful when you want your book to be rendered on "
"every file change. You could repeatedly issue `mdbook build` every time a "
"file is changed. But using `mdbook watch` once will watch your files and "
"will trigger a build automatically whenever you modify a file; this includes "
"re-creating deleted files still mentioned in `SUMMARY.md`!"
